# DeepIMB

DeepIMB is a Python package designed for the imputation of missing microbiome data using deep learning techniques. It leverages TensorFlow to build and train a neural network model that can accurately predict missing values in microbiome datasets.

## Installation

To install DeepIMB, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install DeepIMB


## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started with DeepIMB:

```python
from deepimb.IMBNet import MultiNet
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/data.csv', index_col=0)

# Initialize the deepIMB model
model = deepIMB()

# Fit the model to your data
model.fit(data)

# Predict (impute) missing values
imputed_data = model.predict(data)

# Save or further process `imputed_data` as needed

Requirements
DeepIMB requires the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
These dependencies will be automatically installed when you install DeepIMB using pip.

Features
Easy-to-use interface for imputing missing microbiome data.
Customizable neural network model to fit various dataset characteristics.
Support for different types of microbiome data.
